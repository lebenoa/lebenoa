## Hi, I’m @**Meonako**

I've experienced with
- **C#**
- **GO**
- **Java**
- **JavaScript** (TypeScript is a *VS Code extension* so that doesn't count)
- **Kotlin**
- **PHP**
- **Python**
- A ***lil bit*** of **Rust**
- A ***lil bit*** of **Zig** (My most favorite so far)

Most of them I didn't upload on GitHub.

My go to language is.. ***Rust*** and ***Zig***

I’ll learn everything that **I'm interest** OR it look **fun**
